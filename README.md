# #MeToo Movement
Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Sentiment-Analysis-of-MeToo-Movement.
Analyzing the sentiment of the MeToo movement from the tweets in Twitter.

**Project Motivation**
Fear or shame has kept many people from reporting crimes of sexual harassment or assault. Recently, the “#MeToo” movement has encouraged victims to file complaints to authorities and to gain support from other victims over social media after sharing their traumatic experiences. This movement has had a positive impact on the lives of many victims who otherwise would not have shared their story and who by sharing it have contributed to bringing the assailants to justice. We feel that it is important to understand the different sentiments associated with the movement on social media as well as explore the popularity of the movement. To do this, we will use Python to scrape tweets from the web and explore their popularity through data visualization as well as their polarity by performing sentiment analysis on them. 

**Project Objectives**
1) Web Scraping of Twitter data using the “#MeToo” hashtag 
2) Descriptive data exploration and visualization of the tweets
3) Text mining and sentiment analysis across the tweets

**Standard project flow and NLP techniques used**
1. Lowercasing
2. Punctuation, numeric numbers and special characters removal
3. Tokenization
4. Stop words removal (default + customized)
5. Stemming
6. Removing less/more frequent words using Count Vectorizer
7. Word Cloud/Topic Modeling using LDA 
8. Sentiment Analysis
